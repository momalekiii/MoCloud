### Fixing Gradle Wrapper Issues

If you encounter Gradle wrapper validation errors (especially in CI/CD environments), you can fix them using the provided scripts:

On Unix/Linux/macOS:
```bash
./scripts/fix-gradle-wrapper.sh
```

On Windows:
```cmd
scripts\fix-gradle-wrapper.bat
```

You can also verify the integrity of the Gradle wrapper:

On Unix/Linux/macOS:

./scripts/verify-gradle-wrapper.sh
```

On Windows:
```cmd
scripts\verify-gradle-wrapper.bat
```

These scripts will regenerate the Gradle wrapper checksums which are required for validation.
